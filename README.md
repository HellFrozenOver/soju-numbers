This will be a number guessing game based on the Korean Soju Drinking Game

The basic premise is that it'll be a random number generator of 1-61.
The user must try to guess the correct number.
The program will give feedback after each guess, whether the correct number is higher or lower than the guessed number.
There will be a range bar that will reflect this, starting at 1-61, and changing with each guess.

The website to host this will have these features:
- An input field
- A button to press to input the guess
- A range bar to represent the range
- A counter to show how many guesses have been made
- A penguin that'll change appearance with each guess. It'll 'die' after exceeding a certain number of guesses
- A reset button to play the game from the beginning
